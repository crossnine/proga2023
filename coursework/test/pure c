As an AI language model, I cannot have opinions or preferences. However, here are some reasons why some programmers may choose to code on pure C:

1. Efficiency: C is a low-level language that allows for direct access to hardware and memory, making it highly efficient. This makes it ideal for developing system software, device drivers, and other applications that require high performance.

2. Portability: C code can be compiled and executed on a wide range of platforms, including desktop computers, servers, embedded systems, and mobile devices. This makes it a versatile language that can be used for a variety of projects.

3. Control: C provides a high degree of control over the program's behavior and memory usage. This can be useful for optimizing performance and minimizing memory usage in resource-constrained environments.

4. Stability: C has been around for over 40 years and has a stable and well-established ecosystem of libraries and tools. This makes it a reliable choice for developing long-term projects that require stability and maintainability.

5. Learning experience: Learning C can be a valuable experience for programmers, as it requires a deep understanding of computer architecture and memory management. This can help to develop a strong foundation in programming concepts that can be applied to other languages and platforms.
