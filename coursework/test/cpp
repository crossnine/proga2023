As an AI language model, I can provide you with some information about programming on C++:

C++ is a high-level programming language that is widely used for developing applications, including operating systems, video games, and software applications. Here are some reasons why some programmers may choose to code on C++:

1. High performance: C++ is known for its high performance and speed, making it a popular choice for developing applications that require fast processing speeds.

2. Object-oriented programming: C++ is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it allows developers to create classes and objects that can be reused in different parts of the code. This makes it easier to write complex programs and to maintain and update code over time.

3. Large community: C++ has a large and active community of developers who contribute to open-source libraries and frameworks. This makes it easy to find solutions to common problems and to get help when needed.

4. Compatibility: C++ is compatible with a wide range of platforms and operating systems, making it a versatile language that can be used for many different applications.

5. Control: C++ gives developers a high degree of control over memory management and system resources, which can be important for developing applications that require precise control over these resources.

Overall, C++ is a powerful and versatile language that is well-suited for developing high-performance applications that require control over system resources. Its large community and compatibility with multiple platforms make it a popular choice for many developers.
