Sure, as an AI language model, I can provide you with some information about Ruby:

Ruby is a high-level programming language that is known for its simplicity and productivity. It was created in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro Matsumoto, a Japanese computer scientist. Here are some reasons why some programmers may choose to code on Ruby:

1. Easy to learn: Ruby has a simple and intuitive syntax that makes it easy to learn for beginners. It is often described as a "readable" language because its code is easy to understand.

2. Productivity: Ruby has many built-in features and libraries that allow developers to write code quickly and efficiently. This makes it a popular choice for developing web applications, especially for startups.

3. Object-oriented programming: Ruby is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it allows developers to create classes and objects that can be reused in different parts of the code. This makes it easier to write complex programs and to maintain and update code over time.

4. Rails framework: Ruby on Rails (often shortened to "Rails") is a popular web application framework that is built on top of Ruby. It provides developers with many tools and features that make it easier to develop complex web applications.

5. Large community: Ruby has a large and active community of developers who contribute to open-source libraries and frameworks. This makes it easy to find solutions to common problems and to get help when needed.

Overall, Ruby is a powerful and versatile language that is well-suited for developing web applications, especially for startups. Its simplicity and productivity make it a popular choice for developers who want to write code quickly and efficiently. The Rails framework, built on top of Ruby, provides developers with many tools and features that make it easier to develop complex web applications.
